# Getting Started tutorial projects

<!-- only enough info to differentiate this dir level vs the others; what is different about this dir compared to the sibling dirs? -->
These are completed Visual Studio projects that result from following the steps in the [Getting Started tutorials](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/get-started/get-started).

These are baseline WebView2 projects with a few lines of WebView2 starter code to embed and use the WebView2 control.  You can use one of these projects as a starting point to add additional WebView2 code.
