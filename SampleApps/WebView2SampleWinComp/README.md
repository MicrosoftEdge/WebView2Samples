# Win32 sample app with Visual Composition

<!-- only enough info to differentiate this sample vs the others; what is different about this sample compared to the sibling samples? -->
This sample, **WebView2SampleWinComp**, embeds a WebView within a Win32 native application.  This sample uses Windows Runtime Composition APIs (also called the Visual layer) to take advantage of the latest Windows 10 UI features and create better look, feel, and functionality in C++ Win32 applications.

This sample is built as a Win32 Visual Studio 2019 project.  It uses C++ and HTML/CSS/JavaScript in the WebView2 environment.

To use this sample, see [Win32 sample app with Visual Composition](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/samples/webview2samplewincomp).
